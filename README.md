- **XDP-based packet filtering** for ultra-low latency protection at kernel level
- **Dynamic access rules** with automatic updates from Arxignis API
- **BPF statistics collection** for packet processing and dropped IP monitoring
- **TCP fingerprinting** for behavioral analysis and threat detection
- **TLS fingerprinting** with JA4 support for client identification
- **JA4+ fingerprinting** with complete suite: JA4H (HTTP headers), JA4T (TCP options), JA4L (latency), JA4S (TLS server), and JA4X (X.509 certificates)
- **Automatic TLS certificate management** with ACME/Let's Encrypt integration
- **Threat intelligence integration** with Arxignis API for real-time protection
- **CAPTCHA protection** with support for hCaptcha, reCAPTCHA, and Cloudflare Turnstile
- **Content scanning** with ClamAV integration for malware detection
- **PROXY protocol support** for preserving client IP addresses through load balancers
- **Health check endpoints** for monitoring and load balancer integration
- **Redis-backed caching** for certificates, threat intelligence, and validation results
- **Domain filtering** with whitelist support
- **Wirefilter expressions** for advanced request filtering
- **Unified event queue** with batched processing for logs, statistics, and events
- **Flexible configuration** via YAML files, command line arguments, or environment variables

## Configuration Methods

Moat supports three configuration methods with the following priority (highest to lowest):

1. **YAML Configuration File** - Comprehensive configuration via `config.yaml`
2. **Command Line Arguments** - Override specific settings via CLI flags
3. **Environment Variables** - Set configuration via `AX_*` prefixed environment variables

Configuration from higher priority sources overrides lower priority sources. For example, a YAML file setting will override the same setting from an environment variable.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Degraded Features When Access Logs Disabled

When access log sending is disabled (`AX_ARXIGNIS_LOG_SENDING_ENABLED=false` or `--arxignis-log-sending-enabled=false`), the following features are degraded:

- **Anomaly Detection** - Advanced anomaly detection capabilities are not available without access log data
- **Metrics & Analytics** - Comprehensive metrics and analytics are not available without access log aggregation
- **BPF Statistics** - Statistics can still be collected locally but won't be sent to Arxignis API for centralized analysis
- **TCP Fingerprinting** - Fingerprints can still be collected locally but won't be sent to Arxignis API for behavioral analysis

### CAPTCHA Protection

Moat supports multiple CAPTCHA providers for additional security:

- **hCaptcha** - Privacy-focused CAPTCHA service

#### Configuration

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
server:
  health_check:
    enabled: true                    # Enable/disable health check server
    endpoint: "/health"              # Health check endpoint path
    port: "0.0.0.0:8080"            # Health check server bind address
    methods: ["GET", "HEAD"]         # Allowed HTTP methods
    allowed_cidrs: []                # CIDR restrictions (empty = allow all)
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
AX_SERVER_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true
AX_SERVER_HEALTH_CHECK_ENDPOINT=/health
AX_SERVER_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT=0.0.0.0:8080
AX_SERVER_HEALTH_CHECK_METHODS=GET,HEAD
AX_SERVER_HEALTH_CHECK_ALLOWED_CIDRS=127.0.0.0/8,::1/128
```

#### Usage Examples

**Basic health check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "service": "moat"
}
```

**HEAD request (for load balancers):**
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Restricted access (only localhost):**
```yaml
server:
  health_check:
    allowed_cidrs: ["127.0.0.0/8", "::1/128"]
```

- **Scalable** - Supports multiple network interfaces and concurrent connections


## Notes

- The `--upstream` option is always required for request forwarding
- When TLS mode is `disabled`, Moat runs as an HTTP proxy + firewall
- When TLS mode is `custom` or `acme`, Moat runs as an HTTPS proxy + firewall
- `--tls-only` mode enforces TLS requirements: non-SSL requests return 426 Upgrade Required (except ACME challenges)
- For custom TLS mode, both `--tls-cert-path` and `--tls-key-path` are required
- Domain filtering supports exact matches (whitelist)
- When using Docker, ensure the required capabilities (`SYS_ADMIN`, `BPF`, `NET_ADMIN`) are added
- The XDP program attaches to the specified network interface for packet filtering
- BPF statistics and TCP fingerprinting require XDP to be enabled (not available with `--disable-xdp`)
- Access rules are automatically updated from Arxignis API at regular intervals
- BPF statistics track packet processing metrics and dropped IPs at kernel level
- TCP fingerprinting collects SYN packet characteristics for behavioral analysis
- Fingerprinting supports the complete JA4+ suite:
  - JA4 generates fingerprints from TLS ClientHello messages
  - JA4H generates fingerprints from HTTP request headers
  - JA4T generates fingerprints from TCP SYN packet options
  - JA4L measures packet latencies for network distance estimation
  - JA4S generates fingerprints from TLS ServerHello responses
  - JA4X generates fingerprints from X.509 certificates
- CAPTCHA tokens are JWT-signed for security and can be cached for performance
- Threat intelligence data is cached in Redis to minimize API calls
- Multiple network interfaces can be configured for high availability setups
- Content scanning requires a running ClamAV server and is disabled by default
- PROXY protocol support enables proper client IP preservation through load balancers
- Health check endpoints can be configured for monitoring and load balancer integration
- Access logs, statistics, and events are batched and sent to Arxignis API for analysis
- Configuration priority: YAML file > Command line arguments > Environment variables
